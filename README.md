## Git vs. GitHub
#### Git 
* Git keeps screenshots of your code and does not require GitHub.  
#### GitHub
* GitHub stores you code in a cloud and you can visually track your changes and GitHub requires Git.
  * easier to collaborate

## Repository Setup
1. to set up a repo (short for repository) you first have to set up a directory  
by typing  `mkdir <directory-name>` into the terminal. **make sure you are in**  `~/workspace`

2. then in the you will `cd <name>`. **always**`cd` into the directory after you make it. (`cd` also you to moke from directory to directory you would (`cd <directory-name>`)
3. use `pwd` to check in what directory you are in, after you make sure type in `git init` which initializes git into the directory -> making it a repo.

## Workflow & Commands
###### General commands 
^ : the up arrow can be used as a shortcut to go to previous commands instead of rewriting the command again.  
(tab): the tab button can also be used as a shortcut to auto complete a directories name  
Control D ( C ): will interupts commands incase you type it in wrong.  
Clear: typing `clear` into the terminal to clear the terminal. (you can also _command K_ to clear the terminal)   
`cd` : is used to navigate in and out of directories     
`..` : used to go back one directory. ex: ` cd ..`
